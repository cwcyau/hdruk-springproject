# HDRUK Spring Projects

This is an information page for the HDRUK Spring Projects.

## General information

*Project period:* 7 March 2021 - 11 June 2021.

*Project enquiries:* christopher.yau@hdruk.ac.uk

## Project milestones: 

| Milestone | Timing | Requirement |
| --------- | ---- | ---- | 
| Start-up report | 31 March 2021 | 0.5-1 page background on project start (beyond what was described in proposal) | 
| Mid-term report | 5 May 2021 | Two-page update on progression | 
| Final report | 15 June 2021 | Maximum six-page project report | 

We adopt a **light touch** approach so project reports do not need to be super-refined, publication quality pieces of work. 

Supervisory input will be useful for all reporting stages but the emphasis will be on the project student to produce reports and maintain timelines.
