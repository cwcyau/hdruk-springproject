# HDRUK Spring Projects

This is an information page for the HDRUK Spring Projects.

## General information

*Project period:* 7 March 2021-11 June 2021.

*Other training activities:* Spring project should be the main activity during the project period for HDRUK PhD students. However, during the project period, students maybe required to attend compulsory HDRUK training events. In addition, students will also be developing research proposals for their full PhD projects during the project period. Students should inform project supervisors in advance of these activities.

## Project milestones: 

| Milestone | Timing | Requirement |
| --------- | ---- | ---- | 
| Start-up report | 31 March 2021 | 0.5-1 page background on project start (beyond what was described in proposal) | 
| Mid-term report | 5 May 2021 | Two-page update on progression | 
| Final report | 15 June 2021 | Maximum six-page project report | 

We adopt a **light touch** approach so project reports do not need to be refined, publication quality pieces of work. These reports form part of our commitments to funders on student monitoring.

Supervisory input will be useful for all reporting stages but the emphasis will be on the project student to produce reports and maintain timelines.
